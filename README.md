# LED Traffic Light Simulation

This project simulates a traffic light system using Arduino. Follow the steps below to simulate the project on your computer.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Visual Studio Code (VS Code):**
   - If you haven't already, download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

2. **Wokwi Extension:**
   - Install the [Wokwi for VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wokwi.wokwi-vscode) from the VS Code Marketplace.

### Simulating the Project

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Clone the LED Traffic Light repository to your local machine using Git:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/kevzkip/arduino_LED_Traffic_Lights.git
     ```

2. **Open the Project in VS Code:**
   - Open the cloned repository folder in Visual Studio Code.

3. **Start the Simulator:**
   - Press `F1` to open the command palette in VS Code.
   - Select "Wokwi: Start Simulator" to launch the Wokwi simulator.
   - This action will open the project in your default web browser and enable you to interact with the simulated traffic light system.

4. **Simulate and Test:**
   - Interact with the simulated traffic light system in the browser window.
   - Observe the behavior of the LEDs to verify that it matches the standard traffic light pattern(adjust the time duration).
